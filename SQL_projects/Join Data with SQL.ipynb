Your Turn\nNow it's your turn to try out some challenge queries using the cells below. To start, update the sample query below to:\n- Combine the `states` and `countries` tables into one table.\n- The final result should have a `name` column, a `continent` column, and an `indep_year` column. Use the `local_name` column from the `countries` table as the name.\n- The final result should not include duplicate rows.\n\n🏃&nbsp;&nbsp;**To execute a query, click inside the cell to select it and click \"Run\" or the ► icon. You can also use Shift-Enter to run a selected cell and automatically navigate to the next cell.**","metadata":{},"id":"a419d9e8-38c5-4ae4-8e3a-04cd9e1bfeb0","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"SELECT * \nFROM world.states\nLIMIT 5","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df","initial":false,"integrationId":"c632441c-e1dc-4637-a56d-10b85efd89be"},"id":"a6812e79-4856-4d21-a35e-dde9c1640fdb","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## 3.
